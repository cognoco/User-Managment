# Registration Functionality Analysis

## Components Overview

### 1. RegistrationForm.tsx
- **Status**: In use by RegisterPage.tsx
- **Features**:
  - Comprehensive form with support for both private and corporate users
  - Uses shadcn/ui components for better UI
  - Password strength visualization
  - Corporate user registration with additional fields
  - Integrates with UserManagementProvider
- **Schema**: Uses its own schema definitions with discriminated union for user types

### 2. RegisterForm.tsx (Removed)
- **Status**: No references found in the codebase - removed
- **Features**:
  - Simpler form with basic fields
  - Basic styling with CSS classes
  - No support for corporate users
- **Schema**: Used registerSchema from auth.ts

## API Endpoint

- `pages/api/auth/register.js` - Properly integrated with Supabase for user registration

## State Management

- `auth.store.ts` - Contains the register function that calls the API endpoint

## Schema Discrepancy

There's a discrepancy between the schemas used for registration:

1. **auth.ts Schema**:
   ```typescript
   export const registerSchema = z.object({
     email: emailSchema,
     password: passwordSchema,
     confirmPassword: z.string(),
   }).refine((data) => data.password === data.confirmPassword, {
     message: "Passwords don't match",
     path: ["confirmPassword"],
   });
   ```

2. **RegistrationForm.tsx Schema**:
   - Uses a more complex schema with discriminated union for user types
   - Includes additional fields like firstName, lastName, acceptTerms
   - Has corporate-specific fields like companyName, position, industry
   - Includes more password validation rules

This discrepancy should be addressed to ensure consistency across the application.

## Recommendation

Since RegisterForm.tsx was unused in the codebase and RegistrationForm.tsx provides a more comprehensive implementation that aligns with the requirements in Cursorrules.md (supporting both personal and corporate user paths), we have:

1. Kept RegistrationForm.tsx as the primary registration component
2. Removed RegisterForm.tsx to avoid confusion and maintain a single source of truth
3. Updated API validation to match frontend requirements (8 character minimum)

## Implementation Plan

1. ✅ Verified no hidden references to RegisterForm.tsx exist
2. ✅ Removed RegisterForm.tsx
3. ✅ Updated API validation to match frontend requirements
4. TODO: Add tests for RegistrationForm.tsx
5. TODO: Consider consolidating schema definitions to avoid duplication and inconsistencies

This will streamline the codebase and prevent potential inconsistencies between the two implementations.

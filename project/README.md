# User Management System Implementation Checklist

## Project Overview
This document tracks the implementation of a plug-and-play user management system. The focus is on essential features that are highly useful while maintaining flexibility and ease of integration.

## Testing Setup
The project uses Vitest as its testing framework, configured with the following features:
- JSDOM environment for DOM testing
- React Testing Library for component testing
- MSW (Mock Service Worker) for API mocking
- Full TypeScript support
- Jest-DOM matchers for enhanced DOM assertions

Note: While some files may contain Jest-related references or types (like @testing-library/jest-dom), we exclusively use Vitest for running tests. These Jest-related packages are compatible with Vitest through the provided adapters.

## Core Principles
- **Plug & Play**: Easy to integrate into any React application
- **Flexible**: Database agnostic with clean abstractions
- **Essential First**: Focus on most-needed features
- **Modern UI**: Clean, accessible interface using shadcn/ui
- **Type Safe**: Full TypeScript support
